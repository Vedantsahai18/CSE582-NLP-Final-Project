# Hierarchical Lay Text Summarization Of Wildfire Impacts for Systemic Engineering Practices

Hierarchical Lay Text Summarization of Wildfire Impacts for Systemic Engineering Practices is a project that explores the use of natural language processing techniques to summarize documents related to wildfires. The project uses a hierarchical approach to summarization that combines extractive summarization with abstractive summarization to produce a more accurate and informative summary of the impacts of wildfires on various aspects of society. The goal of this project is to provide a tool for systemic engineering practices to aid decision-making processes related to wildfire management and mitigation. By providing a comprehensive and accessible summary of the impacts of wildfires, this approach can help decision-makers better understand the full scope of the impacts and make more informed decisions about how to address them.

NOTE: The abstractive and extractive models are not uploaded on the github repo due to size. However the models are locally stored on the Azure Workspace where we performed most of the training and can be seen over there. In order to access a particular model please contact the authors of the project.
